# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- The form box can be functional so that we can see the backend aspect more
- We could use real links for the social media handles with an option to add more or different social media icons and links. For example linkedin and youtube ect
- Adding other contact information and a fake address like real sites have :)
- Iinstead of book a table the form is an order form for the coffees :)
